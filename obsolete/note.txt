the delete movie and actor data func can be implemented by taking the 
update func as a base and just reversing the logical statements, 
so it would delete stuff or just make a query for that i dunno

left: 
UNFUCK THE DATES SOMEHOW
for this getEndpoint must return 2 vals, -1 -2, if any nil -> err then use switch or start from -3
-2 -1 so the sort is like 
                          /movie/sort/{param}/{desc,asc}

                          /movie/search/{the name itself} cant be done without lower

figure out how to populate the starring lists with actual names of / actors 
movies +++
